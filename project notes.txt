/********************* Completed *********************/
	1. There should be at least 2 levels of user privilege (from highest to lowest): poster (privilege to post games), player.
	You may rename these levels if you'd like. You may also add more levels (such as an admin above the level of poster)
	if you wish.
	2. All users should have to login before using the system.
	3. There should be a way for users to log out.
	5. All users, as long as they are not suspended, should be allowed to play games.
	6.1 Login/logout
	
/********************* Practical *********************/
	4. There should be a time-out mechanism that terminates a logout after some time period (you decide what) of inactivity.
	
/********************* In Progress *********************/
	6.2 Play games
	[All Users Allowed to Do This]
		6.3 Add/Delete/Suspend player-level users
		6.4 Add/Delete/Suspend poster-level users
/********************* TODO *********************/
	
[player not allowed]
	6.5 Post or remove games
[player not allowed]
	6.6 Change the system-wide time-out limit
	6.7 Initiate a game instance and wait for other players to join
	6.8 Join a game instance initiated by another user (may be limited if some games are by invitation only).
	7. The hub should allow players to download single-player JavaScript-based games which require no further contact with
	the hub to play.
	8. The hub should handle the mechanics of initiating a game having more than one player and waiting for others to join,
	as follows:
	8.1 The player initiating the game should be able to decide which player (first, second, third, etc.) s/he wants to be.
	8.2 The mechanism for starting a game, once there are enough players, is as described in class, namely:
	8.2.1 Once the number of players needed have signed up, each player is given a link which, when clicked, goes to a
	start-up CGI script for the game. This is the First communication with the game software for this instance of
	the game.
	8.2.2 Each link has a query string with the following elements. Elements are separated by ampersands (&) and
	occur in the order given. Assume that
	N is the number of players.
	8.2.2.1 A unique instance identifier (as a string) that uniquely ditainguishes this instance of the game from others.
	8.2.2.2 A base 10 number (as text) giving the number of players
	8.2.2.3 N entries, each a unique player id (the id a player uses to logon to the hub). The entries are separated by
	ampersands. The order gives the player order, namely, the first entry is the first player, the second the
	second, and so on.
	8.2.2.4 The user id of the player to whom the link belongs and who clicked it.
	8.2.2.5 A session key (as a character string) for the player to whom the link belongs.
	9. Once the game hub has sent links to all players about to start a game, it may forget about the game instance
